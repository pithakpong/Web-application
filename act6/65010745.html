        <div>
          <div class="lead">if your first port of arrival in Thailand is Bangkok, you might feel a little apprehensive about the idea of taking to the highway on a road trip. In the Thai capital, cars are stacked bumper to bumper, motorcycles duel for space with pedestrians and seemingly anything goes when it comes to road rules. But breathe easy: Bangkok is not all of Thailand.
            Escape the capital and traffic conditions calm considerably, though you’ll still need to be cautious of speeding trucks and buses and the steady throng of motorcyclists. The good news is that Thailand’s roads are mostly well-maintained, car and motorcycle rental costs are moderate and there’s so much to see that even a short road trip takes on an air of adventure.
            The smart way to road trip in Thailand is to start outside Bangkok, renting a vehicle in one of Thailand’s smaller towns. The further you go off the tourist trail, the quieter the roads and the more there is to discover in the towns and villages you pass through on the way. For inspiration, here are our favorite road trips in Thailand.

        <div>
          <div class="lead">Be forewarned: Bangkok is a beast. Some, like myself, find it irresistibly charming, while others find it a little overwhelming. Either way, it’s the hub of Thailand and you need to experience it. (And if you find it a little too chaotic to explore on your own, then check out the range of local-led day tours run by Intrepid’s sister company, Urban Adventures.)
            Popular day-time activities include visiting Jim Thompson’s house (the ex-pat who revolutionized Thai silk industry) or the out-of-the-ordinary Lingam Fertility Shrine, an area with hundreds of phalluses where locals pray for conception.
            If you arrive on a Saturday or Sunday, you must hit Chatuchak Market (“JJ Market”), arguably the best shopping market in Bangkok (just remember that every price is negotiable).

          <div class="lead">You’ll notice an immediate change of pace in Chiang Mai – cool and mountainous, far less chaotic than the metropolitan Bangkok.
            Upon arriving, drop off your stuff and rent a scooter. These are the best way to explore the city and beyond. You can ride up to Doi Suthep, a famous temple in the mountains that overlooks the city,
             and then continue scooting up the cool and windy roads and all the way up to the small villages at its peak. If you’re feeling more adventurous, you can do one of the many one-day self-guided motorbike trips near the city (“Samoeng Loop” is a popular and moderate day trip).

        <div>
          <div class="lead">If you’re still comfortable on that scooter, I’d say take a day trip around the island and let yourself get lost. One good stop is Sramonora waterfall, a natural pool a bit inland, that’s in between Haat Rin and Baan Tai (turn off the road when you see the sign “river on stone”).
            As it gets later in the day, start asking around about Muay Thai fights (that is, if you don’t hear it blaring from truck speakers throughout the day). There are three stadiums at Baan Tai and two at Haad Rin, so hopefully there’s a fight happening while you’re there (they are a must-watch).
            If you’re feeling energetic, stay a bit later at Haad Rin for some nightlife. Should you arrive on the night of a Full Moon Party, brace yourself. Otherwise, the beach is normally populated with DJs, bars, fire twirlers and gap year students.

          <div class="lead">Pattaya, a famous beach resort city located on the Gulf of Thailand, offers a mix of stunning beaches, nightlife, and outdoor adventures. Pattaya is located around a 2-hour drive from Bangkok.
            Come here after your trip to Bangkok, and visit Nong Nooch Tropical Garden, where you can admire beautiful gardens and watch cultural shows.
            What are the other things to do in Pattaya? When exploring the city you will find the Big Buddha Temple, that offers city panoramas and houses a grand golden Buddha. The Sanctuary Of Truth is a must-see in Pattaya.
            Dive into local culture at Pattaya Floating Market, where you can shop for handicrafts and relish street food.
            For shopping, dining, and entertainment, head to Central Festival Pattaya Beach.

            Find natural beings in Railay Beach, a paradise for beach lovers and adventurers who seek its soaring cliffs.
            Thung Teao Forest Natural Park cradles the Emerald Pool — a tranquil oasis within a lush jungle, a hidden gem in Krabi.
            Krabi serves as a gateway to numerous stunning islands in the Andaman Sea. From Phi Phi Islands to Hong Islands, you can try island-hopping tours and explore different beaches, hidden lagoons, and vibrant underwater ecosystems.

        <div>
          <div class="lead">Hua Hin is a coastal gem of Thailand. If you want to escape Bangkok for a few days, choose Hua Hin. This place is located around 3-5 hours from Bangkok and will be an excellent option for those who can not travel to Thailand islands.
            Hua Hin's must-visit is Cicada Market, which is becoming a canvas of culture, a vibrant blend of art, music, crafts, and flavors, and Khao Takiab's "Monkey Mountain," which reveals coastal vistas and a temple's spiritual vibe.
            Hua Hin offers many different experiences, such as kiteboarding, paddleboarding, and jet skiing. Black Mountain Water Park delights families with slides and lazy river laughter.
            Nature's call resonates in Sam Roi Yot National Park — limestone peaks, hidden caves, and wild wonders.

        <div>
          <div class="lead">Ayutthaya is an ancient capital and modern city 85 km north of Bangkok. It is home to many historical sites and temples, including the Ayutthaya Historical Park, Wat Mahathat, Wat Yai Chai Mongkhon, Wat Ratchaburana, and Wat Chaiwatthanaram.
            You can take a train from Bangkok's Hua Lamphong Station to Ayutthaya. The journey takes around 2 hours and offers a scenic countryside view.The city is located along the Chao Phraya River, making magnificent boat cruises and riverfront exploration accessible.
            The most important thing to see in Ayutthaya is Wat Mahathat. Among the ruins of Ayutthaya, the Buddha head entwined in the roots of a Bodhi tree is a poignant and iconic image that reflects the passage of time and nature's resilience.
